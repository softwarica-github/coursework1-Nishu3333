# Nishu_Pradhan_python_project
# Project one 
# Project name = Cryptography tool (Secure file encryption and decryption )
This python project provides a secure and easy-to-use solution for encryption and decrypting files focusing on a security related things.To protect the confidentiality and sensitivity of files, this tool leverages strong encryption techniques for safeguarding the data.

# Features of project
# 1. Using encryption algorithms
This project employs robust encryption algorithms, specifically AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard with Galois/Counter Mode), to ensure the security of files. AES-GCM provides authenticated encryption, protecting against both eavesdropping and tampering.

# 2. User friendly interface
The tool offers a simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) designed with users in mind. Users can easily generate encryption keys, encrypt files, and decrypt files with just a few clicks. The interface provides clear instructions, making it accessible for users with varying levels of technical expertise.

# 3. Database Storage
Files and encryption keys are securely stored in an SQLite database (file_encryption_db.sqlite). This ensures data integrity and provides a structured approach to managing encryption keys and their associated files.

 # 4. Support for Multiple File Extensions
The tool supports encryption and decryption for various file extensions. Users can secure files with different formats, making it versatile and accommodating for diverse use cases.

# Database Setup
The application uses an SQLite database (file_encryption_db.sqlite) to store encryption keys and encrypted files.
The create_table() function initializes the database tables.

# Testing
This project includes unit tests to verify the correctness of key generation, encryption, and decryption functions with assert.
