The rusty swing creaked back and forth in the deserted playground, whispering secrets to the wind that rustled through the leaves of the ancient oak tree. 
Sunlight dappled the cracked asphalt, momentarily catching the glint of a forgotten child's laughter echoing in the empty space.
A lone crow landed on the swing's weathered chain, its obsidian eyes reflecting the fading blue of the twilight sky.
As if contemplating the stories buried beneath the layers of dust and forgotten dreams
