    The rusty swing creaked back and forth in the deserted playground, whispering secrets to the wind that rustled through the leaves of the ancient oak tree. 
Sunlight dappled the cracked asphalt, momentarily catching the glint of a forgotten child's laughter echoing in the empty space.

As if contemplating the stories buried beneath the layers of dust and forgotten dreams
